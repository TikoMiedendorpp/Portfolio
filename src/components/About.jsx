                        As an 18 year old Dutch student, I am deeply engaged in expanding my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field.
                        By collaborating with fellow students, I have actively participated in challenging projects that have enhanced my 
                        ability to work effectively within a team. As for now, my interests mostly go towards Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence!
